# ReviewNinja-Welcome

**Thanks for letting us show you around!**

What you’re seeing here is a GitHub pull request with the code diffs
showing by default. Feel free to look around.

Over on the right is a panel for issues (GitHub issues) that you can 
connect to a line of code, a few lines of code, or a whole pull request. 

**To open an issue about a line of code**
1. Click on a line number.
2. Enter a Title and Description and click **Submit**.

Note: you can also shift-click to select multiple lines, or click the 
plus icon (**+**) next to the Issues title to create a general issue.

Once you're satisfied that the issue has been addressed, you can go 
ahead and close it. 

**To close an issue**, click **Close issue**. If we’ve 
over-complicated that, let us know.


Another key feature, you need to know about, is ninja stars. Ninja 
stars are how you communicate that a pull request is okay to merge. 
You can set, by repository, how many ninja stars you think pull 
requests should have before merging.

**To add a ninja star**, click the **ninja star** button.

When your pull request no longer has any open issues, and has received 
a sufficient number of ninja stars, it’s ready to merge!

**To merge the pull request**, click **Merge pull request**.

That’s it! These are the basic features of ReviewNinja to help you get 
started. We hope you enjoy using the tool, and please 
[let us know](https://github.com/reviewninja/review.ninja/issues/new) 
how we can make it better.
